Solutions in Go for Cracking the Coding Interview.

Change directory into any of the chapter subdirectories and run

    go test

Each subdirectory contains a test file and a solution file. Clone the repo and
try creating your own solution without referring to the existing solution.

There is an empty test function at the bottom of each test file. Implement the
function and uncomment the function name from the `Solutions` array above the
function so that it will be included when you test.
